# git-workshop-public
A bunch of materials used for teaching Git VCS.

## Pro Git
The workshop contents are based on an extremely useful book *Pro Git* written by **Scott Chacon** and **Ben Straub**. The book is available [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 "Get Pro Git book") and I higly recommend checking it out.

## LaTeX Beamer template
The presentations enclosed to this repository were prepared with *Metropolis* LaTeX Beamer theme created by **Matthias Vogelgesang** and available [here](https://github.com/matze/mtheme "Get Metropolis LaTeX Beamer theme").
